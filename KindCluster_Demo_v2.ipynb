   "source": "# Finding Attack Paths in Kubernetes with KubeHound\n\nThis notebook demonstrates how to use KubeHound to discover security vulnerabilities in a Kubernetes cluster by analyzing *attack paths*. Attack paths are the chains of misconfigurations that allow an attacker to move from an initial breach to full cluster compromise.\n\n**What you'll learn:**\n- Why graph-based analysis reveals risks that vulnerability lists miss\n- How to trace attack paths from external entry points to cluster compromise\n- How to prioritize findings by focusing on realistic attack scenarios\n- How to use KubeHound's DSL to answer real security questions\n\n**The approach:** We'll start by looking at EVERYTHING (overwhelming!), then progressively filter down to find the attack paths that a real attacker could exploit."
